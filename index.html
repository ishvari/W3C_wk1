    <h1>My Favorite Recipes</h1>
    <p>Here are 3 of my favorite recipes that I would like to share with you all. I think they would make a lovely full course meal for anyone looking to hold a dinner party or wanting to cook for someone special</p>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Chick Pea and Leek Soup</h3>
    
    <p>This is a Jamie Oliver Recipes that my brother introduced me to and I absolutely love!</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>340gr/12oz chickpeas, soaked overnight (I add more - a whole bag of dried chickpeas or two cans of chickpeas)</li>
        <li>1 medium potato, peeled (optional)</li>
        <li>5 medium leeks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>knob of butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, finely sliced</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>850ml/1 ½ pints chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>EV olive oil</li>
        <li>Bacon is also an option you can consider</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How to Prepare:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the soaked chickpeas, cover with water, and cook with the potato until tender, about 1 hour. (you could add a rasher of smoked bacon and a bouquet garni and remove when the chickpeas are cooked).</li>
        <li>Remove the outer skin of the leeks, slice lengthways from the root up, wash carefully and slice finely.</li>
        <li>Warm a thick bottomed pan, and add the tablespoon of oil and the knob of butter. Add the leeks and garlic to the pan and sweat gently with a good pinch of salt until tender and sweet. Add the drained chickpeas and potato and cook for 1 minute. Add about two-thirds of the stock and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now decide if you want to puree the soup in some sort of processor, or leave it chunky and brothy, or do what I do which is puree half and leave the other half whole - this gives a lovely smooth comforting feel but also keeps a bit of texture. Now add enough of the remaining stock to achieve the consistency you like. Check for seasoning, and add Parmesan to taste to round off the flavours.</li>
    </ol>
        </li>
            
        <li><h3>Halibut with Lemon Sauce</h3>
    
    <p>OK this one goes to Marth Stewart. I like it super lemony!</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Zest of 3 lemons</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup plus 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh dill</li>
        <li>4 halibut fillets or other firm white fish (8 ounces each) </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, cut into thirds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How to Prepare:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the lemon zest, sugar, salt, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and dill. Place fillets in a shallow, nonreactive container. Cover with lemon-dill marinade, and refrigerate 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove fish from container; set marinade aside. Heat a large saute pan coated with olive oil. Saute fillets until golden and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from heat; transfer fillets to a platter. Cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Turn heat to high; add reserved marinade. When it bubbles and browns, add remaining lemon juice. Cook 1 minute. Reduce heat to low. Add butter, swirling pan to melt. Remove pan from heat. Pour sauce over fillets, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
        </li>
        
        <li><h3>Healthy Banana Icecream</h3>
    
    <p>This one only needs one ingredient but can be mixed with a number of different options of your choice</p>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>3 Overrip bananas</li>
        <li>1/2 tables spoon of milk (optional)</li>
    </ul>
            
    <p>Optional Toppings:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Spoonful of peanut butter</li>
        <li>Drizzle of honey</li>
        <li>Handful of chocolate chips</li>
        <li>A few almonds (or nut of your choice)</li>
        <li>Dollop of Nutella</li>
        <li>Chopped strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries</li>
        <li>Half a teaspoon of cinnamon, cardamom, or ginger</li>
    </ul>
            
    <p>How to Prepare:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the bananas and slice them thickly.</li>
        <li>Lay them on a plate and freeze until solid, around 2 hours</li>
        <li>Put them in the blender or food processor and turn the machine on to blend them. At first they will want to spin around and stay icy, but keep at it, stopping the machine and using the wooden spoon to loosen the mixture if it stops moving. At some point, it will suddenly go creamy and custardy, like soft-serve ice cream—but if it doesn’t, add a little milk and blend until it does. - See more at: http://www.chopchopmag.org/recipe/one-ingredient-banana-ice-cream#sthash.FMorO9Ca.dpuf</li>
        <li>Serve right away or store in the freezer in a lidded container.</li>
    </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
